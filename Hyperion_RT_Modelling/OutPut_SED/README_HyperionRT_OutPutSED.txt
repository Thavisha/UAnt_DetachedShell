############################### Radiative Transfer Modelling using Hyperion ############################################

Convolve the output SEDs of each model from running Hyperion with the filter profiles of the SED point. 

Carry out comparison between the observed global SED and the model SEDs using Reduced Chi sqaured per data point.


###### Input files required ####################

1) .rtout files (e.g: Model_FourShells+ContEm_EvenMass.rtout) generated from Hyperion output for each of the six (or user chosen) models - The .rtout files generated for this paper are once again too large to be uploaded for GitHub. Please email lead author if they are required. 
2) Ampere_FiterProfile_Library.hdf5 - This file is too large to be uploaded to Github. It will be made public with the AMPERE introudction paper by Scicluna et al., in prep. In the mean time please email the lead-author for the filter library.  
3) Observed_SED.csv
